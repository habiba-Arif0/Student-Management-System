# Student-Management-System
Java Swing Student Management System

Project Overview:

This project is a Student Management System developed using Java Swing and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system is designed to manage student records efficiently through a user-friendly graphical interface.

The application allows users to add, update, delete, search, and filter student records. Student data is stored persistently using file handling, ensuring that records remain saved even after the program is closed.

To enhance performance and demonstrate core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts, the project integrates Insertion Sort for organizing student data and Binary Search for fast record searching.

The project follows proper OOP concepts such as:

Encapsulation for data security

Inheritance for code reuse

Abstraction for clean design

Polymorphism for flexibility


This system is suitable for small academic institutions and serves as a practical implementation of Java GUI development, OOP, file handling, and DSA concepts taught in software engineering courses.
